ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my names Henry. Im a PhD student at the Univeristy of Bristol at the Compass (CoMPputational Statistics and data Science) Centre for Doctoral Training, my supervisor is Rihuan Ke. 

ðŸ”¬ My research focuses on methods for self-supervised learning. In particular contrastive methods and energy based models. I'm creating novel loss functions which can learn better general representations of data, that can be used to help execute arbitrary tasks. In particular focusing on loss functions that may provide elegant solutions to currently challenging problem areas such as multi-task, multi-modal, continual, online, etc. learning.
